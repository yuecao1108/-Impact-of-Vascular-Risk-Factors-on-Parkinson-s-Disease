Recording date of birth will give the most detailed information required for calculation of age and is recommended as first choice. However, in some studies recording date of birth may elicit discussions on a potential violation of privacy legislation and specifically HIPAA regulations. In these cases, the calculated age should be recorded.
MG/NMD/SMA: This is recorded for each brain MRI performed. This is a derived field from Date of Birth and Visit Date.
HEADACHE: It is recommended that age be calculated from date of birth and the study enrollment date. However, if age needs to be collected (e.g., full date of birth is not allowed to be collected) then it should be recorded in months and years.

Determine the usual predictability of OFF function whether due to dose, time of day, food intake or other factors.
