# Impact of Vascular Risk Factors on Parkinson’s Disease


About 80% of individuals with PD will develop dementia within 15 years of disease onset but the rate of progression to dementia is very heterogeneous and this still leaves 20% without dementia at 15 years. Determining modifiable risk factors for dementia development would improve clinical care and provide better counseling to patients. Significant research has shown that vascular risk factors contribute to dementia in non-PD populations. Vascular risk factors generally include smoking status, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes, etc. 

A cohort study was established by The National Institute of Neurological Disease (NINDS) and we have obtained data from patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and a control group. The goal of this data analysis is to determine the impact of vascular risk factors on the development of PD-related cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment can be assessed with the MoCA score. Normal MoCA score is anything > or = 26. Mild Cognitive Impairment is more controversial but generally > or = 20. Dementia is 19 or less. 

The first aim of this analysis is to find out the relationship between the Framingham Score, a summary of modifiable vascular risk factors, and cognitive impairment; the second aim is to identify the relationship between vascular risk factors (such as hypertension, obesity or smoking) and cognitive impairment. We focus on the baseline observations in this study.

Figure 1 shows the MoCA score distribution of data collected from different sites and it indicates that there was no significant site difference in the collected data.

We modeled the relationship between MoCA score and potential risk factors using multiple linear regression where the MoCA score was treated as a continuous outcome, and multinomial logistic regression where it was treated as a categorical outcome, as demonstrated below.

The results of the multiple linear regression model for Aim 1 below show that Framingham score, PD/Control flag, most education categories, and Hamilton Depression Score are of statistically significance, with p-values less than 0.05. With the Framingham score increasing by 0.1, the MoCA score would decrease by 0.45 on average, with a 95% confidence interval of [-0.45, -0.37]. This means individuals with a higher Framingham score would have a lower MoCA score, i.e. greater cognitive impairment.
