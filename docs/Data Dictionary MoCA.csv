However, in some studies recording date of birth may elicit discussions on a potential violation of privacy legislation and specifically HIPAA regulations. In these cases, the calculated age should be recorded.MG/NMD/SMA: This is recorded for each brain MRI performed. This is a derived field from Date of Birth and Visit Date.HEADACHE: It is recommended that age be calculated from date of birth and the study enrollment date.
