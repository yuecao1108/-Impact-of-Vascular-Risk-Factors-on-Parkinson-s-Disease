Recording date of birth will give the most detailed information required for calculation of age and is recommended as first choice. However, in some studies recording date of birth may elicit discussions on a potential violation of privacy legislation and specifically HIPAA regulations. In these cases, the calculated age should be recorded.
MG/NMD/SMA: This is recorded for each brain MRI performed. This is a derived field from Date of Birth and Visit Date.
HEADACHE: It is recommended that age be calculated from date of birth and the study enrollment date. However, if age needs to be collected (e.g., full date of birth is not allowed to be collected) then it should be recorded in months and years. This element is recommended as Core for pediatric headache studies.

For years completed, code the number of years attained (0-30 years), normed to someone moving full time at the usual pace, i.e. a year that was repeated counts as only 1 year and the usual single-year full-time load completed over several years counts as 1 year. Certificate and technical programs do NOT count no matter how specialized.    The number of years of typical completion of the relevant program is counted. If the subject obtained their education outside the United States, ask about their educational system to estimate the correct coding - Internship, Residency, and Fellowship years are experiential training and do not count.
